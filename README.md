# Spy-Phrase-Generator

This is an extremely simple web app that generates a "Spy Phrase". 
A new phrase is generated every time a user clicks the button.

Phrases are generated in two parts: 
1. A 'subject' is chosen randomly from an array of options,
2. A 'verb' is chosen randomly from another array of options. 
The two parts are then combined and shown to the user.

HTML/JavaScript with Bootstrap.
